Most of the people are using mobile phones for online transactions. In this case most
transactions are done through internet banking. The existing Cryptography is failed to provide security
due to rendering technology hence it becomes a major concern in terms of providing security and
privacy. ElGamal and Digital Signature are combined to address the existing challenges and provide
effective security. ECC has a major role in improving data integrity and confidentiality. However, the
data carried over a wireless network will not be highly secure as a result. We are unable to use these
strategies to prevent problems with wireless networks' increased packet transmission issues, which
result in data loss. To overcome the problems in the existing system, the proposed system is promoted
with an authentication process involving digital signatures of the user in its implementation.
A group of points plotted on an image is provided to the user for him to use his cognitive
abilities and remember the points he has selected the first time he uses the system. Coming to the
process of ElGamal scheme, a private key is generated using these selected points for the user. Some
mathematical operations are performed on the points to attain the digital signatures. With the help of
the now obtained private key and a base point, a public key for this user is also generated. The other
authenticated entry follows suit thus far. Now, in order for them to have a connection and basically
validate each other, a session key needs to be generated on either end which is required to be equal.
After generating and verifying the session key, both the end users are now set to communicate with
each other. A message sent by either user is then encrypted using the method of elliptic curve
cryptography. Thus sent message is now decrypted and digitally signed on the receiver end.
1.1 Cryptography :
Cryptography is a method of protecting information and communications through the use of
codes, so that only those for whom the information is intended can read and process it. In computer
science, cryptography refers to secure information and communication techniques derived from
mathematical concepts and a set of rule-based calculations called algorithms, to transform messages in
ways that are hard to decipher. These deterministic algorithms are used for cryptographic key
generation, digital signing, verification to protect data privacy, web browsing on the internet and
confidential communications such as credit card transactions and email. Cryptography is closely
related to the disciplines of cryptology and cryptanalysis. It includes techniques such as microdots,
merging words with images and other ways to hide information in storage or transit. However, in
today's computer-centric world, cryptography is most often associated with scrambling (ordinary text,
sometimes referred to as clear text) into ciphertext (a process called encryption), then back again
(known as decryption). Individuals who practice this field are known as cryptographers.

Modern cryptography concerns itself with the following four objectives:
 Confidentiality : The information cannot be understood by anyone for whom it was unintended.
 Integrity : The information cannot be altered in storage or transit between sender and intended
receiver without the alteration being detected.
 Non-repudiation : The creator/sender of the information cannot deny at a later stage their
intentions in the creation or transmission of the information.
 Authentication : The sender and receiver can confirm each other's identity and the
origin/destination of the information.
